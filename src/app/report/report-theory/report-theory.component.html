  How can teams leverage these findings to gain a competitive edge? I believe so, in the form of a radical new system of goalie management. Teams can achieve more consistent, high caliber aggregate goaltending performances, by enacting this simple system:
</p>

<h3>The Goalie Bullpen System (GBS)</h3>

<p>
  After each goal allowed, a goaltender swap will take place under the following condition:
</p>

<pre>
  <small>totalShots < (goal * Math.max(15 - ((goal - 1) * 2), 10));</small>
</pre>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-3 col-sm-4 col-xs-4"><h5>Goal</h5></div>
  
  <div class="col-md-4 col-sm-8 col-xs-8"><h5>Swap If Shots Less Than</h5></div>
</div>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-3 col-sm-4 col-xs-4">1st</div>
  
  <div class="col-md-3 col-sm-4 col-xs-4">15</div>
</div>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-3 col-sm-4 col-xs-4">2nd</div>
  
  <div class="col-md-3 col-sm-4 col-xs-4">26</div>
</div>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-3 col-sm-4 col-xs-4">3rd</div>
  
  <div class="col-md-3 col-sm-4 col-xs-4">33</div>
</div>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-3 col-sm-4 col-xs-4">4th</div>
  
  <div class="col-md-3 col-sm-4 col-xs-4">40</div>
</div>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-3 col-sm-4 col-xs-4">5th</div>
  
  <div class="col-md-3 col-sm-4 col-xs-4">50</div>
</div>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-3 col-sm-4 col-xs-4">...</div>
</div>

<h4>Benefits</h4>
<h5>
  Maximizes elevated performance levels at the start of an appearance
</h5>

<p>
  Presupposing a correlation between performance and confidence, and that a goaltender's confidence is adversely affected by allowing a goal, the data on this isn't surprising. Perhaps what might be surprising is the extent of the correlation - a .914 save percentage goalie averages .918 before the first goal vs .911 after!
</p>

<h5>
  Risk management
</h5>

<p>
  The point at which a coach might consider a goalie change is usually after a catastrophic start to the game (at which point momentum is almost irrevocably one-sided), or amidst a blowout (at which point the game is thoroughly out of reach). GBS is proactive about preventing these types of situations, swiftly responding to early signs of trouble.
</p>

<h5>Pressure management</h5>

<p>
  It's widely accepted that being a goaltender at the NHL level is once of the most high-pressure positions in sports. It'd be reasonable to attribute the degradation of performance after every goal to this pressure. GBS acts as a safety net - it prevents poor runs of play from snowballing into terrible performances, while affording ample time to regroup after allowing a goal.
</p>

<h4>There is, of course, a pitfall (but one that can be addressed)</h4>

<p>In my dataset, save percentage is .914. But if you filter by appearances where the goalie comes in cold off the bench, it drops to <i>.904</i>.</p>

<p>
  Yikes. That doesn't exactly support my case for GBS. But there are a couple of massive issues with that dataset.
</p>

<p>
  First, that data is derived largely from non-competitive situations, where the opponent is dominating the game.
</p>

<p>
  Second, of the 22362 total appearances in the data, only 1580 are from goalies coming off the bench. So if goalie on the bench to start a game has less than an 8% chance of playing. Given this, backups amount to an afterthought in a hat. Their preparation isn't the same as the starter's, and they spend the game dormant apart from occasionally saving the team from a stray puck. With GBS, a backup is as essential to the framework of the team as any other player. They are more than likely going to appear in the game, and would be expected to stay loose and prepared.
