  How can teams leverage these findings to gain a competitive edge? I believe so, in the form of a radical new system of goalie management. Teams can achieve more consistent, high caliber aggregate goaltending performances, by enacting this simple system:
</p>

<h3>The Goalie Bullpen System (GBS)</h3>

<p>
  After each goal allowed, a goaltender swap will take place under the following condition:
</p>

<pre>
  <small>totalShots < (goal * Math.max(15 - ((goal - 1) * 2), 10));</small>
</pre>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-3 col-sm-4 col-xs-4"><h5>Goal</h5></div>
  
  <div class="col-md-4 col-sm-8 col-xs-8"><h5>Swap If Shots Less Than</h5></div>
</div>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-3 col-sm-4 col-xs-4">1st</div>
  
  <div class="col-md-3 col-sm-4 col-xs-4">15</div>
</div>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-3 col-sm-4 col-xs-4">2nd</div>
  
  <div class="col-md-3 col-sm-4 col-xs-4">26</div>
</div>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-3 col-sm-4 col-xs-4">3rd</div>
  
  <div class="col-md-3 col-sm-4 col-xs-4">33</div>
</div>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-3 col-sm-4 col-xs-4">4th</div>
  
  <div class="col-md-3 col-sm-4 col-xs-4">40</div>
</div>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-3 col-sm-4 col-xs-4">5th</div>
  
  <div class="col-md-3 col-sm-4 col-xs-4">50</div>
</div>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-3 col-sm-4 col-xs-4">...</div>
</div>

<h4>Benefits</h4>
<h5>
  Maximizes elevated performance levels at the start of an appearance
</h5>

<p>
  Presupposing a correlation between performance and confidence, and that a goaltender's confidence is adversely affected by allowing a goal, the data on this isn't surprising. Perhaps what might be surprising is the extent of the correlation - a .914 save percentage goalie averages .918 before the first goal vs .911 after!
</p>

<h5>
  Risk management
</h5>

<p>
  The point at which a coach might consider a goalie change is usually after a catastrophic start to the game (at which point momentum is almost irrevocably one-sided), or amidst a blowout (at which point the game is thoroughly out of reach). GBS is proactive about preventing these types of situations, swiftly responding to early signs of trouble.
</p>

<h5>Pressure management</h5>

<p>
  It's widely accepted that being a goaltender at the NHL level is once of the most high-pressure positions in sports. It'd be reasonable to attribute the degradation of performance after every goal to this pressure. GBS acts as a safety net - it prevents poor runs of play from snowballing into terrible performances, while affording ample time to regroup after allowing a goal.
</p>

<h4>There is, of course, a pitfall (but one that can be addressed)</h4>

<h5>The data shows us that goalies coming off the bench produce considerably worse performances</h5>
